### Prerequisites

For this project, is recommended to have `Python3` installed.

### Run
#### Installing virtual environment
virtualenv is used to manage Python packages for different projects. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could break system tools or other projects. You can install virtualenv using pip.
```
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

#### Creating a virtual environment
Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH
```
python3 -m venv env
```

#### Activate local environment
Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific `python` and `pip` executables into your shell’s `PATH`.
```
source env/bin/activate 
```

You can confirm you’re in the virtual environment by checking the location of your Python interpreter, it should point to the env directory.
```
which python
```

For deactivate the virtual environment
```
deactivate
```

Get the dependencies using this command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Database Initialization
```
python manage.py db init
```

Create a migration script from the detected changes in the model using the `migrate` command. This doesn't affect the database yet.
```
python manage.py db migrate --message 'Initial Database migration'
```

Apply the migration script to the database by using the `upgrade` command
```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

#### Run your server
```
python manage.py run
```

Open the following url on your browser to view swagger documentation
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Using Postman
Authorization header is in the following format:
```
Key: Authorization
Value: "token_generated_during_login"
```

## Running the tests

To run tests use the following command
```
python manage.py test
```

Also, it's a good test for your local environment to check if is everything OK and ready to go.
